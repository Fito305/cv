  <p><i><strong>Real estate broker, licensed health & life insurance agent, former law enforcement deputy sheriff, and investor.</strong></i></p>
  <p><em><strong>Biography<br></strong>
      I'm a Cuban-American male that has lived in <strong><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">South Florida</a></strong> for the majority of my life. I immigrated here with my parents when I was one year old. Since, I have built a lot of working
      experience by doing a multitude of different jobs in a
      variety of sectors. I'm a very motivated and intelligent individual in the search of excellence both in my work and
      personal life. Also, fitness is a big part of my life. I spend countless hours in the gym to improve both my energy and wellbeing.
      Additionally, I spend a great amount of time self-educating myself. I read a lot of books ranging from investing (options/long term), science, psychology, mathematics, biographies, real estate, and many more. My favorite books are, “You Too Can
      Be a Stock Market Genius”, “The Intelligent Investor”, “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”, “Unleash the Giant Within”, “Think and Grow Rich”, “The Navigator”, and “The E-Myth Revisited”. As Sir Isaac Newton said
      himself, “If I have seen further than others, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants.”</em></p></td>
